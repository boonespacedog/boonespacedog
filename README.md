# Hi, I'm Oksana (@boonespacedog)

## What I Do

I build **AI research workflows** for high-abstraction theoretical physics and mathematics—demonstrating Python, data science, and machine learning through real scientific questions.

## My Journey

Between 2012-2016, I rediscovered physics and formulated research questions that became blog posts and even a science fiction novel. Now I've come full circle: those "big ideas" became my sandbox for learning **Data Science**, **Python**, and **AI-assisted research**.

## What Makes My Work Different

I orchestrate **complex AI R&D workflows** at the theory construction level—working with deep subject-matter experts while staying **general, strategic, and agile**. My strength is navigating oblique problems where vertical depth meets horizontal integration.

**Current focus:**
- Multi-agent AI orchestration for mathematical physics research
- Computational validation of theoretical frameworks
- Bridging operator algebras, quantum information, and cosmology

## Projects in This Portfolio

- **Fractional Laplacian on Curved Manifolds**: Heat kernel expansions with curvature corrections
- **Surjection-to-QEC Framework**: Group theory meets quantum error correction
- **432-Group Structure**: Discrete cosmology and (maybe) baryon asymmetry hypotheses
- **Complexity-Vector**: No-go theorem proving scalar impossibility in multi-pillar complexity measures
- **Omega Mod M**: Number theory meets computational verification—Selberg-Delange law for prime omega functions (when I was fascinated with primes and ternary computing)
